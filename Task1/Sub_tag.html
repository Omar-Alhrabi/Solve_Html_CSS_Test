    <h1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</h1>
    <P>An equations that has maximum degree one is linear Known as linear equations. The graph of it is stragiht line.</P>
    <p>For Example,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>y = 8x - 2</li>
        <li>ax<sub>1</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub>- cx<sub>3</sub>= 9 </li>
    </ul>
    <p>are some of the example of linear equations in two and three variables</p>
    <pre>slope of intersection of two linear equations Linear equations
y<sub>1</sub>=mx<sub>1</sub>+ a and
y<sub>2</sub>=mx<sub>2</sub>+ b
for the point P(X<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub> )is:
<b>m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)/(x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)</b>
